# Image-Detection-and-Captioning
VisuaLingo is an AI-powered Streamlit web app that detects objects in images and generates meaningful captions automatically. It uses YOLOv8 for object detection, BLIP for image captioning, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, combining computer vision and natural language processing in one project.
